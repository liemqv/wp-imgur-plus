- You can use a premium account from imgur to avoid this
- Imgur have a limit about how many images can be uploaded by users (Hundres of images are the limit, so don't worry you will not have problems)
- Once you put all your images in the server you cannot revert images back to the server, but you can deactivate autosync and new images will be store only in your server.
